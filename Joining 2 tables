Table 1 
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name
FROM customer;


Table 2
select payment_id, amount 
from payment;


Joining each table and column that I want to see 
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, p.payment_id, p.amount
FROM customer c
join payment p
on c.customer_id = p.customer_id


Order customers payments 
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, sum(p.amount)
FROM customer c
join payment p
on c.customer_id = p.customer_id
group by c.first_name
order by c.first_name;


Concatenation 
SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, concat('$', format(sum(p.amount),2)
FROM customer c
join payment p
on c.customer_id = p.customer_id
group by c.first_name
order by c.first_name;
